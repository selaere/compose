this thing can autogenerate wincompose ``.XCompose`` files with diacritics and stuff. they probably 
work in linux too, i haven't checked. 

i made this for my ``es`` keyboard layout, the default settings use keys like ñ and ç and · and ¿
that won't be available on most keyboards. make sure to customize it for your own keyboard (see 
``custom_dia.py``)

as of now the code is bad and uncommented and sus. this will probably change
